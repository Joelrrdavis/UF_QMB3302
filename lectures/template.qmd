# Definitions of Analytics and AI

## Definitions of Analytics and AI

- **Analytics**: supports decisions with data-backed insight  
- **AI**: participates in decisions through automation + judgment under uncertainty  
- The difference is often **how outputs are used**, not the math

::: notes
Open by framing both as parts of decision systems. Emphasize that the boundary is practical (deployment + autonomy), not philosophical.
Avoid “AI = magic”; define it as decision participation in uncertain settings.
:::

## Analytics is a progression of questions

- **Descriptive**: what happened?
- **Diagnostic**: why did it happen?
- **Predictive**: what is likely to happen?
- **Prescriptive**: what should we do?

::: notes
Use a single business story (e.g., inventory or subscription business) to show the same domain question evolving across the four types.
Keep definitions short—students will confuse these without concrete examples.
:::

## Same business problem, four analytics roles

- Descriptive: “Stockouts increased last month.”
- Diagnostic: “They spiked after supplier delays.”
- Predictive: “Next month’s stockout risk is 0.35.”
- Prescriptive: “Increase reorder point for items A/B.”

::: notes
Important: emphasize that prescriptive requires an objective and constraints; it’s not “a fancier prediction.”
You can swap in a different example later (fraud, churn, staffing) as long as the pattern remains.
