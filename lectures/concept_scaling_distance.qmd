## What problem are we solving?

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- Models often rely on the idea of “closeness”
- But numbers can live on very different scales
- Large numbers can dominate small ones
- Distance becomes distorted
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## Why this appears in your code

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- You often see a step called “scaling”
- It shows up before modeling
- It feels mechanical or mysterious
- But it exists for a simple reason
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## The core idea

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- Many models compare observations using distance
- Distance assumes numbers are comparable
- Raw features often are not
- Scaling makes comparison meaningful
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

## The mental model

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- Imagine measuring distance using mixed units
- Inches for one feature
- Miles for another
- One dimension overwhelms the rest
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## What “close” means to a model

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- “Close” means similar feature values
- Similarity depends on scale
- A small numeric change can matter a lot
- Or not matter at all
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## Why units matter

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- Age measured in years
- Income measured in dollars
- One ranges from tens
- The other from thousands
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## What goes wrong without scaling

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- Large-scale features dominate distance
- Small-scale features are ignored
- The model listens to the loudest variable
- Not the most informative one
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## What scaling actually does

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- Puts features on comparable footing
- Prevents any one feature from overpowering others
- Restores balance in distance calculations
- Makes “closeness” meaningful again
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## Why this must be conceptual

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- The math explanation overwhelms beginners
- The intuition is simple
- Distance depends on scale
- Scale determines influence
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## A common misconception

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- Scaling does not add information
- It does not improve data quality
- It changes how comparisons work
- Not what the data contains
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---

## What this is *not*

::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- Not feature engineering
- Not normalization for beauty
- Not required for all models
- A fix for distance distortion
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
:::
:::

---
## Check point: 


::: columns
::: column{width="50%"}
- **Scaling ensures that “distance” reflects meaning, not units**
:::

::: column{width="50%"}
