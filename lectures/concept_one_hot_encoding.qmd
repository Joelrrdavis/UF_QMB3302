## Why This Concept Exists

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}


- Real datasets contain **categorical variables**
  - neighborhood
  - product type
  - category labels
- Most models only operate on **numbers**
- We need a way to translate categories **without adding meaning that isn't there**

## Why This Concept Exists

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}


| Feature        | Raw Value     |
|----------------|---------------|
| Neighborhood   | Old Town      |
| Product Type   | Electronics   |
| Store Format   | Outlet        |

## The Tempting (But Wrong) Shortcut



:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}


- Assign numbers to categories: (Red = 1, Blue = 2, Green = 3)
- This creates **fake structure** (order and distance)
- Models interpret these numbers as meaningful quantities

::: {.column width="50%"}

## What Goes Wrong When We Do This

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- The model may assume:
  - Blue (2) is "greater than" Red (1)  
  - Green (3) is twice as far from Red (1) as Blue (2)  
- None of this reflects reality  
- The representation misleads the model

## The Core Idea Behind One-Hot Encoding

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Replace a single categorical column with **multiple yes/no indicators**  
- Each indicator answers one question:
  - Is Color = Red?  
  - Is Color = Blue?  
  - Is Color = Green?

## One-Hot Encoding (Red / Blue / Green)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

| Color | Is Red | Is Blue | Is Green |
|-------|-------:|--------:|---------:|
| Red   | 1      | 0       | 0        |
| Blue  | 0      | 1       | 0        |
| Green | 0      | 0       | 1        |

## What One-Hot Encoding Preserves

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- No ordering between categories  
- No distance between categories  
- Equal treatment of all labels  
- A numeric representation models can safely use

## What Changes in the Dataset

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Fewer categories → more columns  
- One categorical variable becomes **several numeric features**  
- This is a structural change, not a data cleaning step  

The *meaning* of the data is preserved,  
but the *shape* changes.

## Why You Rarely See This Step Directly

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- One-hot encoding is:
  - tedious to manage manually  
  - easy to apply inconsistently  
- Modern workflows **automate** this step

## How This Connects to the Main Workflow

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- One-hot encoding is a **translation step**  
- It happens before modeling  
- It is part of preprocessing, not model fitting  
- Usually see it in pipelines (maintains consistency, no data leaks)

## Takeaway

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Categories (often) must be translated into numbers  
- Assigning numbers directly creates false meaning  
- One-hot encoding avoids this problem  
- Pipelines hide the mechanics so you can focus on modeling
