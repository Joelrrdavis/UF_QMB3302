## The confusion we need to fix

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Its easy to assume the model knows the truth
- Predictions feel authoritative
- Outputs look precise
- This creates false confidence
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## The core idea

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- A model does not know reality
- It learns a rule from data
- That rule approximates patterns
- Approximation is not understanding
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## The mental model

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- A map is not the territory
- A summary is not the full story
- A model is a compressed representation
- Compression always loses detail
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
:::

## Why models feel “wrong” sometimes

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Real systems are messy
- Models simplify aggressively
- Edge cases are ignored
- Errors are expected
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
:::

## Why this matters later

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Performance will never be perfect
- Coefficients may not align with intuition
- Predictions may fail in new settings
- None of this means the model is broken
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Check point: 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **A model is a rule that summarizes patterns, not a mirror of reality**
