# Welcome

# Goldilocks Rule

## Purpose and Importance

> "Humans experience **peak motivation** when working on tasks that are just beyond their current ability.
> Not too hard.  
> Not too easy.  
>Just right." 
> ~ *James Clear, Atomic Habits*



## Too Pessimistic

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- “No one here can learn this stuff.”
- “It’s too complex and requires years of calculus and matrix algebra...”
- Requires “a secret decoder ring.”  
- → Leads to disengagement → despair → and dramatic emails about dropping the class.

## Too Optimistic

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- “This is so easy!”
- “Each of you will become an expert in multivariate statistics by tomorrow.”
- Unrealistic expectations → frustration and loss of motivation.

## Just Right

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- DBA students from **any background**, even with **no prior experience**, can:
  - Learn this material.  
  - Build a solid foundation.  
  - Continue learning effectively.  
- “Just right” may differ for everyone.

## Key Takeaway
- *Just right*: start from where you are.  
- Build a foundation to continue learning.  
- I’ll assume **no prior experience** (though I know that’s not strictly true).  


# Course Structure

## Syllabus Overview
- Lectures + applied examples.
- In-class exercises.
- Open-book quizzes.
- Collaborative problem solving.


## Exercises: Practice Through Doing
- Exercises occur during class sessions.

### In-Class Exercises: Collaborative Learning
- You’ll form a **team**.
- Submit your work **during class**.
- Graded for **completion only**. 
    - A good college effort is 100%. If you call it in, it's 0%. 



## At-Home Quizzes
- Open book, open notes, open Google.  **Anything goes**.
- Read the quiz notes carefully:
  - Right answers explain *why* they’re right.
  - Wrong answers explain *why* they’re wrong.
- Two attempts per quiz.
- Review feedback - it is important for the inperson quizzes.



## In-Class Quizzes
- Open **your own notes** (typed or handwritten).  
- No computer, no textbook, no instructor materials.
- One attempt only.
- These are (obviously) harder. 

- **First in-class quiz:** right after your return — be prepared!  
- **Second in-class quiz:** higher stakes — cumulative coverage. Hard, this one exam will have the largest impact on your grade.

## **Assessment Structure Overview**

| Stage | Timing | Access | Learning Goal | 
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Exam 1 (In-Class)** | first residency | Own notes only | Baseline conceptual reasoning |
| **Exam 1R (Take-Home Reflection)** | Immediately after | All resources allowed | Deepen understanding; identify gaps | 
| **Exam 2 (In-Class)** | Second in-residency | Own notes only | Apply concepts to new but analogous problems | 

## 💡 Why R?

R is a programming language built for **data analysis, reproducibility, and transparency**.  

We use R instead of point-and-click software (like SPSS) because it allows us to:

- **See every analytical step**: code is documentation.  
- **Reproduce results** easily (important in research and consulting).  
- **Scale** from simple stats to complex models without changing tools.  
- **Integrate code + visuals + narrative** (as you see in this document).  
- **Automate and share** workflows with collaborators.


## 📦 Getting Started

```r
# Install packages if needed
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "janitor"))

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# Load example data
ames <- read_csv("data/ames.csv") |> clean_names()

# Glimpse structure of the data
glimpse(ames)

```



# Closing Thoughts:
- **Progress**, not **perfection**.
- Find your own “just right” zone.
- Don't freak out.
