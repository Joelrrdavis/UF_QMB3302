Title: Debugging Loop Behavior (Evaluating)
21) What is the problem with the following code?

<pythonpre>for i in range(3):
print("Looping")</pythonpre>

a) The loop will not execute
@ No. The loop structure is valid but improperly formatted.
*b) Missing indentation
@ Yes. The body of the loop must be indented to avoid an error.
c) The range is incorrect
@ No. The range(3) is valid and runs three times.
d) SyntaxError due to parentheses
@ No. Parentheses are correctly used.

Title: Creating a Function to Return Results (Creating)
22) Which of the following correctly defines a function that returns the product of two numbers and 10 added to it?

a)
<pythonpre>def calculate(a, b):
return a + b * 10</pythonpre>
@ No. This code adds a and multiplies b incorrectly.

b)
<pythonpre>def calculate(a, b):
return (a * b) + 10</pythonpre>
@ Yes. This function correctly multiplies a and b, then adds 10.

c)
<pythonpre>def calculate(a, b):
print((a * b) + 10)</pythonpre>
@ No. This prints the result but does not return it.

d)
<pythonpre>calculate(a, b):
return (a * b) + 10</pythonpre>
@ No. The def keyword is missing.

Title: Analyzing a Nested Loop (Analyzing)
23) What is the output of the following code?

<pythonpre>for i in range(2):
for j in range(2):
print(i, j)</pythonpre>

a) 0 0, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1
@ Yes. The outer loop runs twice, and the inner loop also runs twice for each value of i.
*b) 0 0, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1
@ Correct. The nested loops generate all combinations of i and j in the ranges.
c) 0 1, 1 0
@ No. This omits some combinations.
d) 1 1
@ No. All combinations are printed, not just the final one.

Title: Predicting Conditional Behavior (Analyzing)
24) What will be printed by the following code?

<pythonpre>x = 4
if x > 2 and x < 5:
print("In range")
else:
print("Out of range")</pythonpre>

a) In range
@ Yes. The condition x > 2 and x < 5 is True, so the first branch executes.
*b) In range
@ Correct. Both parts of the condition are satisfied.
c) Out of range
@ No. The condition evaluates to True.
d) None
@ No. The code ensures an output is printed.

Title: Writing a Function with a Default Parameter (Creating)
25) Which of the following correctly defines a function with a default value for a parameter?

a)
<pythonpre>def greet(name):
print("Hello", name)</pythonpre>
@ No. This does not include a default value.

*b)
<pythonpre>def greet(name="World"):
print("Hello", name)</pythonpre>
@ Yes. The parameter name has a default value of "World".

c)
<pythonpre>def greet("World"):
print("Hello", World)</pythonpre>
@ No. Parameters cannot be strings.

d)
<pythonpre>def greet(name, "World"):
print("Hello", name)</pythonpre>
@ No. Parameters cannot be strings or separated this way.
