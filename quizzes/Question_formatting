#Question formatting

Each question must begin with a question number, followed by either a period “.” or a
parentheses “)” and a space.
Example: 3)
Example: 3.
The question wording must follow the question number. (Note: at least one space should be
between the question number and the question wording.)
Example: 3) Who determined the exact speed of light?

Each answer must begin with a letter (A-Z) followed by a parentheses “)”, a space, and the answer wording.
Example: 3) Who determined the exact speed of light?
a. Albert Einstein
b. Albert Michelson
c. Thomas Edison
d. Guglielmo Marconi

Other Elements (Multiple Choice)
A Title should be created for each question. Titles must be placed at
the beginning of a question and begin with “Title:” followed by the actual text for the title.
Example: Title: Speed of Light
3) Who determined the exact speed of light?
a. Albert Einstein
b. Albert Michelson
c. Thomas Edison
d. Guglielmo Marconi

For questions being imported to an Exam file, you must mark the correct answers with an asterisk (*) directly in front of the answer choice (do not put a space
between the asterisk and the answer choice).
Example: Title: Speed of Light
3) Who determined the exact speed of light?
a. Albert Einstein
*b) Albert Michelson
c) Thomas Edison
d. Guglielmo Marconi

For each question explain why the right answer is the right answer using this format for importing feedback below. For the wrong answer choices, try not to explain the wrong answers by giving them the right answer. Instead explain why it is wrong. Try to choose wrong answers that are plausible not ridiculous

To import feedback for individual answer choices of multiple-choice questions, place the feedback immediately after the answer choice and begin the line with the @ symbol. There must be at least one space between the @ symbol and the feedback text.
Example:
Title: Speed of Light
3) Who determined the exact speed of light?
a. Albert Einstein
@ No. Albert Michelson determined the exact speed of light.
*b) Albert Michelson
@ Yes. Albert Michelson won the Nobel Prize for Physics for determining the exact speed of light.
c) Thomas Edison
@ No, Thomas Edison did not determine the exact speed of light.
d. Guglielmo Marconi
@ No. Marconi did not discover the exact speed of light, but he did win the Nobel Prize for Physics for his work with radio waves.

If you are including code, i need it in a specific format. Start the code chuck with <pythonpre> and end it with <pythonpre> for example:

Title: Using python as a calculation
4) What would result from running the below in Python?

<pythonpre>2 + 2</pythonpre>

a. X
@ No. x is often used in variable assignment, but we are not doing that here. 
*b) 4
@ Yes. 2 + 2 is equal to 4. 
c) 2
@ No, the '+' acts as an operator. There are several kinds of operators in python. Try some of them! <pre> 2-1 </pre>
d. Guglielmo Marconi
@ No.
