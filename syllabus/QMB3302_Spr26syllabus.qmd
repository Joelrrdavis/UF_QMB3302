## COURSE DETAILS {.unnumbered}

### Welcome to the course!

This course is designed to introduce you to the basics of data analytics, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We also introduce some foundational knowledge and skills in the powerful programming language Python. It assumes no prior coding experience. Over the semester we progress through three integrated modules: four weeks focused on essential Python skills, four weeks on core machine learning techniques, and four weeks on large language models (LLMs) and contemporary AI applications. Together, these modules build the technical fluency and conceptual understanding needed to engage confidently with data-driven tools and AI systems in academic, professional, and organizational settings.

Why learn Python? Python remains the dominant language for analytics and AI. It combines simple syntax with a very broad system of libraries for conducting this kind of work. It is used extensively across industries, everything from technology and consulting to retail, finance, and healthcare. It is used by organizations such as Google, Amazon, NASA, Deloitte, and countless startups. Its open-source nature also makes it accessible and cost-effective for individuals and firms alike. Developing proficiency in Python enables you to automate tasks, analyze data rigorously, and implement models that support data-informed decision-making.

Machine learning and AI have become essential tools in modern organizations. Firms generate enormous volumes of data, yet competitive advantage depends on the ability to convert that data into actionable insights. Understanding the principles behind predictive models, classification systems, and LLM-based tools is a baseline expectation for emerging business professionals. Whether your future career is in marketing, finance, operations, consulting, or entrepreneurship, the ability to interpret and evaluate AI systems, and to understand their limitations, will enhance your effectiveness in the workplace. 

By the end of the course, you will have both (1) practical skills for working with Python and core machine learning methods, and (2) broad AI literacy that enables you to engage thoughtfully with the evolving landscape of intelligent systems.

### PREREQUISITES

For relevant course prerequisites, please refer to [one.uf](https://one.uf.edu).

This course is suitable for those with no programming experience.

### COMPUTER AND SOFTWARE

The coding portions of the course assume a Python 3 installation with several standard libraries (such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib). The download and all required software is free. Although UF APPS has the required software, a local installation is strongly preferred.

For problems with UF APPS or connectivity (WIFI), please contact the [UF Help Desk](http://helpdesk.ufl.edu/), or call 352-392-4357.

### TEXTBOOK:

We will make very occasional use of the below textbooks, both available free and online. Readings from these textbooks will be posted in Canvas.

1. **VanderPlas, J. (2016).** _Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data._ O'Reilly Media, Inc.  
  [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)  
   This text is required and available for free online.

2. **VanderPlas, J. (2016).** _A Whirlwind Tour of Python._ O'Reilly Media, Incorporated.  
  [Whirlwind Tour Of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/)  
   This text is required and available for free online.

### OFFICE HOURS

I have standing office hours on Wednesdays from 1-3 PM. No appointment is necessary. The weekly announcement will note if office hours for the week have changed, it is important you check this. If you wish to reserve a specific time, you may do so online using the scheduler [Office Hours Booking](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/OfficeHoursJoelDavis@uflorida.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/) (also available in Canvas) to reserve preferred times. You need to be logged in to a UF account (VPN or Microsoft 360) to book. When reserving time, you may see times available at other times of the week. If these are open and available to book, you are free to use that tool to reserve a meeting at those times. Please use the notes section of the reservation to send me any detail regarding the topic if you feel that is needed. It is fine, and even nice, to just come and say hello. You don't need a burning reason to book a chat. I assume the office hours booked 1-on-1 are in person, in my office. But if you prefer to meet online or outside, mark that in the notes. If you would like to meet via Zoom/Teams, block the time and send a meeting invite in Microsoft Teams or Zoom.


### INSTRUCTOR COMMUNICATION

The best way to get a hold of me is via email or Canvas messages. It is important when you email about an issue that you tell me a little bit about yourself, at a minimum, just include the class number. I try to answer all emails within 24 hours during the week. On weekends, it will take longer.

## ACADEMIC POLICIES

: Final Grade Calculation {#tbl-letters}

### LECTURES

You will watch prerecorded course lectures within the course website pages. You will be responsible for all material presented in lectures. Lectures occasionally will be used to clarify and summarize the text, but will also include material not covered in the text. Please note that exam and assignment questions may come from material discussed verbally in the lecture. Additional videos may be posted throughout the course to answer student questions. The content of these will not be on the exams. Optional videos will be clearly labeled in the video title, the announcement, or the discussion post. If it is not labeled optional, questions in the exams may draw from the video. 

### QUIZZES AND EXAM DETAIL

**NOTE:** The number and weight of the assignments may be reduced during the semester at the discretion of the instructor. If a quiz or assignment is removed, the points for that assignment are also removed and are no longer considered when calculating the final grade. The module exams get harder, so the first module exam is by far the easiest. The third is almost all conceptual, and covers very advanced topics. You should plan on spending some time preparing for these. 

#### WEEKLY QUIZ

Most weeks of the course have a quiz. The quiz is open book, open notes, and untimed. 

Weekly quizzes may be attempted up to *three* times. After each attempt, students will be shown which questions were answered incorrectly. This feedback is intended to support learning through correction and reflection. The highest score across the three attempts will be recorded. All attempts must be completed before the quiz deadline; no additional attempts will be granted after the deadline. This policy is designed to encourage deliberate practice and mastery of course concepts while maintaining clear performance standards.

Students are encouraged to use the first quiz attempt as a diagnostic opportunity to identify gaps in understanding. After reviewing feedback from incorrect responses, subsequent attempts should be used to correct misconceptions and demonstrate improved understanding of the material. Repeated attempts are most effective when spaced and approached thoughtfully, rather than completed in rapid succession. The goal of multiple attempts is learning through revision, not trial-and-error guessing. This is all to say: Take your time on these. They are the best instrument for preparing for the harder exams when done thoughtfully.

The due date for the quizzes (always the same each week) is posted on Canvas. I offer a 2-day automatic "grace" period for every quiz. This is intended to be used for emergencies only. The quiz is due on the due date. Without penalty and without approval, you can turn it in up to 2 days late. Keep in mind, of course, that were something to occur during the grace period, this would not be an adequate reason for an extension. You will need to show that you were not able to complete the quiz on time by the original due date, and that the 2-day grace period was inadequate to recover from that incident or problem and take the quiz. I believe these situations will be extremely rare.

At the end of the course, the 2 quizzes with the lowest grade will be dropped (not counted).

The quizzes in this course are designed to give you feedback on your current level of understanding. Many of the questions on the quiz have additional details and feedback available when the wrong/right answer is chosen. Be sure to read this after you have completed the quiz. This is important even if you scored very well; the additional details will help solidify your understanding of the material. 

A word about late or missing quizzes: I understand that sometimes life, minor illness, other classes, and just plain mistakes are made, and a quiz is missed or completed late. I don't want to be the judge and jury of your misfortune. Sometimes bad things happen. The dropped quizzes and automatic grace period of 2 days per quiz allow you the privacy and flexibility to prioritize without worrying about my judgment or having one mistake result in a major grade impact. This grading does not remove an opportunity to make up a quiz due to an excused absence (see below), but given the generous "drop 2" policy and 2 days grace for grading, I would assume these are rare. The quizzes are open for 7 days; students who anticipate issues with conflicting activities should complete the quizzes earlier in the week. I believe, and hope you agree, this policy is clear, fair, and flexible. I ask in return that if you truly need an exception beyond this built-in flexibility, that you are clear and honest about that need.

The first weeks quiz: The first weeks quiz is easier/lighter than most. It can take some time to get registered and get started, so some additional flexibility is also built in to ensure you have sufficient time to take the quiz. Do not procrastinate until the final day, there are multiple assessments due on that day. 

### MODULE EXAMS (3)

The module exams exam will be drawn evenly from all lectures, worksheets, readings and quizzes that occurred in that module. They are not deliberatly cumulative. By that I mean they do not try and test materials from earlier modules. Each test is meant to stand on its own. That said, the course material builds on itself, so having a firm grasp on prior material will absolutely be beneficial. The exams are proctored using Honorlock. Students are not permitted to use the internet or work with others during the exams. Students can and should have a programming environment open for the Module 1 (week 4) and Module 2 (week 8) test. 

**Open windows:** The module exams are open for 7 days. This includes some days where NEW material is introduced. The new material is limited during these weeks, to allow time to prepare for the exam. Module exams, like quizzes have a 2 day grace period. The lighter material introduction + 2 days grace should be more than sufficient to prepare if you have been keeping up in the class so far. There are no make-ups for missed exams related to an unexcused absence. Missing one of these test will significantly impact your grade, please plan accordingly. 

### COLLABORATION

Writing code and performing data analytics is often a collaborative exercise. You are free to discuss on Canvas or elsewhere any materials from the lectures or workbooks. Quizzes, and exams are individual efforts only. Please do not post answers or solutions from these in the forums or elsewhere online.

#### Use of Generative AI tools or other AI tools

You are permitted to use generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or similar technologies) for most course activities, including the graded quizzes, exercises, and assignments. However, AI tools may not be used during the module exams, which are intended to assess your individual understanding.

## UNIVERSITY POLICIES

### ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Students with disabilities who experience learning barriers and would like to request academic accommodations
should connect with the disability Resource Center by visiting [Getting Starting - Disability resources](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/). It is important for students to share their accommodation letter with their instructor and discuss their access needs, as early as possible.  

### ONLINE COURSE EVALUATION PROCESS
Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in
this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback
in a professional and respectful manner is available at [Gator eval student guidance](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/)
Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the
email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or via [Gator evals](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/). Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at [Gator evals public results](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).  

### CLASS RECORDING
Students are allowed to record video or audio of class lectures. However, the purposes for which these
recordings may be used are strictly controlled. The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal educational
use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for,
a criminal or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically, students may not publish
recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor.

A “class lecture” is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular
subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered
by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of
Florida course. A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations
such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes,
tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the
faculty or lecturer during a class session.

Publication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To “publish” means to share, transmit,
circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person
(or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a
recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or
in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet,
or third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may
be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline
under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.

Should all or part of this class or open study sessions be offered via an online mechanism during this
semester, our sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back and for enrolled
students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or
utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent
to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image.
Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices
recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during these sessions, you will need
to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the ”chat” feature, which allows
students to type questions and comments live.
