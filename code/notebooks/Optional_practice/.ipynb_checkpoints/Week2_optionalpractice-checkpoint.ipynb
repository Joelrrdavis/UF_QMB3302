    "### Optional Practice Workbook: Control Structures and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "# This workbook is designed to help you practice the concepts of `for` loops and functions.\n",
    "# The goal is to reinforce your understanding by experimenting with code and solving small challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Section 1: Exploring `for` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Iterate Over a String\n",
    "# Write a `for` loop to iterate through each character in the string \"Python\" and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "word = \"Python\"\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Iterate Over a List\n",
    "# Write a `for` loop to iterate through the list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and print each number doubled.\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3: Create a Range\n",
    "# Use a `for` loop with the `range()` function to print numbers from 1 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4: Nested Loops\n",
    "# Write a nested `for` loop to print a multiplication table (from 1x1 to 5x5).\n",

    "## Exercise 6: Summing Numbers\n",
    "# Write a `for` loop to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list `[4, 7, 1, 9, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [4, 7, 1, 9, 3]\n",
    "# Your code here\n",

    "\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 9: Sum of a List Function\n",
    "# Define a function called `sum_list` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 10: Find the Average\n",
    "# Define a function called `average` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n",
