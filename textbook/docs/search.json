    "text": "Welcome to the course!\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the basics of data analytics, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We also introduce some foundational knowledge and skills in the powerful programming language Python. It assumes no prior coding experience. Over the semester we progress through three integrated modules: four weeks focused on essential Python skills, four weeks on core machine learning techniques, and four weeks on large language models (LLMs) and contemporary AI applications. Together, these modules build the technical fluency and conceptual understanding needed to engage confidently with data-driven tools and AI systems in academic, professional, and organizational settings.\nWhy learn Python? Python remains the dominant language for analytics and AI. It combines simple syntax with a very broad system of libraries for conducting this kind of work. It is used extensively across industries, everything from technology and consulting to retail, finance, and healthcare. It is used by organizations such as Google, Amazon, NASA, Deloitte, and countless startups. Its open-source nature also makes it accessible and cost-effective for individuals and firms alike. Developing proficiency in Python enables you to automate tasks, analyze data rigorously, and implement models that support data-informed decision-making.\nMachine learning and AI have become essential tools in modern organizations. Firms generate enormous volumes of data, yet competitive advantage depends on the ability to convert that data into actionable insights. Understanding the principles behind predictive models, classification systems, and LLM-based tools is a baseline expectation for emerging business professionals. Whether your future career is in marketing, finance, operations, consulting, or entrepreneurship, the ability to interpret and evaluate AI systems, and to understand their limitations, will enhance your effectiveness in the workplace.\nBy the end of the course, you will have both (1) practical skills for working with Python and core machine learning methods, and (2) broad AI literacy that enables you to engage thoughtfully with the evolving landscape of intelligent systems."

    "section": "QUIZZES, SIMULATIONS AND EXAM DETAIL",
    "text": "QUIZZES, SIMULATIONS AND EXAM DETAIL\nNOTE: The number and weight of the assignments may be reduced during the semester at the discretion of the instructor. If a quiz or assignment is removed, the points for that assignment are also removed and are no longer considered when calculating the final grade. The module exams get harder, so the first module exam is by far the easiest. The third is almost all conceptual, and covers very advanced topics. You should plan on spending some time preparing for these.\n\nWEEKLY QUIZ\nMost weeks of the course have a quiz. The quiz is open book, open notes, and untimed. Each quiz can be taken twice, and the highest score is retained. The due date for the quizzes (always the same each week) is posted on Canvas. I offer a 2-day automatic “grace” period for every quiz. This is intended to be used for emergencies only. The quiz is due on the due date. Without penalty and without approval, you can turn it in up to 2 days late. Keep in mind, of course, that were something to occur during the grace period, this would not be an adequate reason for an extension. You will need to show that you were not able to complete the quiz on time by the original due date, and that the 2-day grace period was inadequate to recover from that incident or problem and take the quiz. I believe these situations will be extremely rare.\nAt the end of the course, the 2 quizzes with the lowest grade will be dropped (not counted).\nThe quizzes in this course are designed to give you feedback on your current level of understanding. Many of the questions on the quiz have additional details and feedback available when the wrong/right answer is chosen. Be sure to read this after you have completed the quiz. This is important even if you scored very well; the additional details will help solidify your understanding of the material.\nA word about late or missing quizzes: I understand that sometimes life, minor illness, other classes, and just plain mistakes are made, and a quiz is missed or completed late. I don’t want to be the judge and jury of your misfortune. Sometimes bad things happen. The dropped quizzes and automatic grace period of 2 days per quiz allow you the privacy and flexibility to prioritize without worrying about my judgment or having one mistake result in a major grade impact. This grading does not remove an opportunity to make up a quiz due to an excused absence (see below), but given the generous “drop 2” policy and 2 days grace for grading, I would assume these are rare. The quizzes are open for 7 days; students who anticipate issues with conflicting activities should complete the quizzes earlier in the week. I believe, and hope you agree, this policy is clear, fair, and flexible. I ask in return that if you truly need an exception beyond this built-in flexibility, that you are clear and honest about that need.\nSome of the questions for the quizzes are from a question pool. You should not expect second attempts at a quiz to be identical. On a retake, the questions may change. The new questions from the pool may look very similar to the first quiz questions. It is critical if you want to improve your grade that you read and complete each question again carefully, and not just plug in your answers from your first quiz attempt.\nThroughout the course, you’ll encounter occasional graded survey-style questions. These questions are worth just a few points, and are graded for completion (completing the survey is full points). They are an easy way to add some cushion to your grade. Their purpose is to give you a chance to reflect on your learning and to help me (your instructor) gauge how the class is progressing. Your responses help identify what concepts are clear, what might need more explanation, and how I can improve the course in real time. Your honest input is greatly appreciated and contributes to making this a more responsive and effective learning experience for everyone.\n\n\nMODULE EXAMS (3)\nThe module exams exam will be drawn evenly from all lectures, worksheets, and readings that occurred in that module. They are not deliberatly cumulative. By that I mean they do not try and test materials from earlier modules. Each test is meant to stand on its own. That said, the course material builds on itself, so having a firm grasp on prior material won’t hurt. The exams are proctored using Honorlock. Students are not permitted to use the internet or work with others during the exams. Students can and should have a programming environment open for the Module 1 (week 4) and Module 2 (week 8) test.\nOpen windows: The module exams are open for 7 days. This includes some days where NEW material is introduced. The new material is limited during these weeks, to allow time to prepare for the exam. Module exams, like quizzes have a 2 day grace period. The lighter material introduction + 2 days grace should be more than sufficient to prepare if you have been keeping up in the class so far.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION\nWriting code and performing data analytics is often a collaborative exercise. You are free to discuss on Canvas or elsewhere any materials from the lectures or workbooks. Quizzes, simulations, and exams are individual efforts only. Please do not post answers or solutions from these in the forums or elsewhere online.\n\nUse of Generative AI tools or other AI tools\nYou are permitted to use generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or similar technologies) for most course activities, including the graded quizzes, exercises, and assignments. However, AI tools may not be used during the midterm or final exam, which are intended to assess your individual understanding."

The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor.\nA “class lecture” is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class session.\nPublication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To “publish” means to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.\nShould all or part of this class or open study sessions be offered via an online mechanism during this semester, our sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during these sessions, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the ”chat” feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live."

    "text": "Welcome to the course!\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the basics of data analytics and machine learning using the powerful programming language Python. No prior programming experience is required. The course is structured into two main sections. Students will first learn the basics of Python and how to write programs in Weeks 1-6. Weeks 6+ progress to using Python to solve real world analytical problems.\nWhy learn Python? Python is rapidly becoming the language of choice fordata scientists, data analysts, and those working on cutting edge business analytics. It is the tool of choice for this work at companies such as Google,Amazon, Facebook, IBM, NASA, Accenture, and Deloitte. It is also free to use, making it widely available to firms and users around the world. Beyond business analytics, Python is often used as a general programming language to automate tasks.\nWhy learn machine learning? Businesses today often use data to solve complex problems. A business that ignores the data it generates is at a significant disadvantage. The skills required to analyze and interpret that data are in short supply. A basic understanding of Artificial Intelligence and how it is used in business will be critical for tomorrows business leaders. Regardless of the domain a student decides to work in after graduation, it is likely that AI skills will make them more competitive in the job market."

    "text": "QUIZZES, SIMULATIONS AND EXAM DETAIL\nNOTE: The number and weight of the assignments may be reduced during the semester at the discretion of the instructor. If a quiz or assignment is removed, the points for that assignment are also removed and are no longer considered when calculating the final grade. The final exam is harder than the midterm and the quizzes, so it is advisable to go into the final exam with a very good grade.\n\nSIMULATIONS\nThe simulation exercises test your understanding of the material to that date in the course. The first exercise has more coding, while the second exercise is almost exclusively related to testing your knowledge, understanding, and application of the analytics and AI approaches discussed in the lectures.\nNote on Grading the Simulation Assignments: This simulation is intentionally challenging and designed to stretch your thinking. To ensure the grading reflects effort and relative mastery rather than absolute perfection, final scores will be curved based on the top 25% of performers. The average score of that top quartile will be mapped to full credit (40 points), and all other scores will be scaled proportionally. This approach ensures fairness while maintaining high standards. In practical terms this means when receiving your grade for this exercise, you should not panic. Once the exercise is complete, the curve will be calculated. The grades and the mapping used to generate them will be posted.\n\n\nWEEKLY QUIZ\nMost weeks of the course have a quiz. The quiz is open book, open notes, and untimed. Each quiz can be taken twice, and the highest score is retained. The due date for the quizzes (always the same each week) is posted on Canvas. I offer a 2-day automatic “grace” period for every quiz. This is intended to be used for emergencies only. The quiz is due on the due date. Without penalty and without approval, you can turn it in up to 2 days late. Keep in mind, of course, that were something to occur during the grace period, this would not be an adequate reason for an extension. You will need to show that you were not able to complete the quiz on time by the original due date, and that the 2-day grace period was inadequate to recover from that incident or problem and take the quiz. I believe these situations will be extremely rare.\nAt the end of the course, the 2 quizzes with the lowest grade will be dropped (not counted).\nThe quizzes in this course are designed to give you feedback on your current level of understanding. Many of the questions on the quiz have additional details and feedback available when the wrong/right answer is chosen. Be sure to read this after you have completed the quiz. This is important even if you scored very well; the additional details will help solidify your understanding of the material.\nA word about late or missing quizzes: I understand that sometimes life, minor illness, other classes, and just plain mistakes are made, and a quiz is missed or completed late. I don’t want to be the judge and jury of your misfortune. Sometimes bad things happen. The dropped quizzes and automatic grace period of 2 days per quiz allow you the privacy and flexibility to prioritize without worrying about my judgment or having one mistake result in a major grade impact. This grading does not remove an opportunity to make up a quiz due to an excused absence (see below), but given the generous “drop 2” policy and 2 days grace for grading, I would assume these are rare. The quizzes are open for 7 days; students who anticipate issues with conflicting activities should complete the quizzes earlier in the week. I believe, and hope you agree, this policy is clear, fair, and flexible. I ask in return that if you truly need an exception beyond this built-in flexibility, that you are clear and honest about that need.\nSome of the questions for the quizzes are from a question pool. You should not expect second attempts at a quiz to be identical. On a retake, the questions may change. The new questions from the pool may look very similar to the first quiz questions. It is critical if you want to improve your grade that you read and complete each question again carefully, and not just plug in your answers from your first quiz attempt.\nThroughout the course, you’ll encounter occasional ungraded survey-style questions—typically placed at the end of quizzes or activities. These questions are worth zero points and will not impact your grade. Their purpose is to give you a chance to reflect on your learning and to help me (your instructor) gauge how the class is progressing.\nYour responses help identify what concepts are clear, what might need more explanation, and how I can improve the course in real time. While optional, your honest input is greatly appreciated and contributes to making this a more responsive and effective learning experience for everyone.\n\n\nMIDTERM AND FINAL EXAM\nThe midterm exam will be drawn evenly from all lectures, worksheets, and readings that occurred up to that point in the course (Weeks 1-6). The final exam covers all the material after the midterm to the end of the course. It does not test material from prior to the midterm, but it is important to note that much of the code and analytics post-midterm is built on that earlier learning. You are responsible for all assigned material. Students should have a notebook up and running for the exam to assist with validating answers to code completion problems. The exams are proctored using Honorlock. Students are not permitted to use the internet or work with others during the exams.\nMIDTERM EXAM: The exam will be open and available to take anytime during the date range in Canvas. This may change slightly from this syllabus if we are behind or some event causes a delay.\nFINAL EXAM: The exam will be open and available to take anytime during the date range in Canvas. The dates in this syllabus are the current planned open and close dates for the exam, but Canvas should be your guide.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION\nWriting code and performing data analytics is often a collaborative exercise. You are free to discuss on Canvas or elsewhere any materials from the lectures or workbooks. Quizzes, simulations, and exams are individual efforts only. Please do not post answers or solutions from these in the forums or elsewhere online.\n\nUse of Generative AI tools or other AI tools\nYou are permitted to use generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or similar technologies) for most course activities, including the graded quizzes, exercises, and assignments. However, AI tools may not be used during the midterm or final exam, which are intended to assess your individual understanding."

    "text": "CLASS RECORDING\nStudents are allowed to record video or audio of class lectures. However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used are strictly controlled. The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor.\nA “class lecture” is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class session.\nPublication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To “publish” means to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.\nShould all or part of this class or open study sessions be offered via an online mechanism during this semester, our sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during these sessions, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the ”chat” feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live."

The data for this course is stored in Canvas.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use This Textbook\nThe material is organized into three types:\n\n1. Weekly Modules\nThese chapters follow the course schedule and lectures. The readings from the text are not identical to the lectures, but they are close. The readings introduce new concepts, connect them to analytics and AI practice, and provide examples to run independently.\nStart here:\n\nWeek 1 – What is Analytics & AI?\n\nWeek 2 – Python Basics\n\nWeek 3 – Data Structures & Pandas\n\nWeek 4 – From Data to Models\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Practical Guides (Task-Oriented Documentation)\nThese pages provide focused instructions for installing tools, configuring environments, and resolving common issues.\n\nHow to Install Python\n\nInstalling the Course requirements.txt\n\nUsing Google Colab\n\nThese guides remain relevant throughout the semester and may be updated as tools evolve.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Learning Philosophy\nThis textbook is built around two related objectives:\n\nAI Literacy: developing conceptual understanding of modern analytics and AI systems. How they work, where they succeed, and where they sometimes fail.\n\nJob-Relevant Skills: Translating these concepts into practical, executable workflows using Python and contemporary tools.\n\nEach week reinforces both trajectories: one conceptual, one applied.\n\n\n\nAccessing Code and Data\nAll example code for the course is maintained in the main GitHub repository:\n\nCode folder: code/ (available in GitHub and Canvas) Data folder: data/ (available in Canvas only)\n\nYou may download the entire repository as a .zip file or clone it directly.\nLinks to specific scripts and notebooks appear at the end of each week’s chapter.\n\n\n\nNeed Help?\nIf you encounter technical issues with installation, environments, or package setup, consult the Guides section using the navigation bar above. These pages provide step-by-step instructions tailored for this course."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to the course. This week, our goal is orientation:\n\nUnderstand how the course is structured (4 weeks Python, 4 weeks ML, 4 weeks LLMs).\nClarify expectations and workflow.\nGet a big-picture view of analytics and AI.\nRun your first Python code and confirm your environment is set up correctly.\n\nWe will use the same pattern every week:\n\nThis HTML file acts as your mini-textbook.\nCode blocks are written in Python and can be executed in a notebook or VS Code.\nQuarto will extract all Python code into a single file for the week: week01_main.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow to use this document\n\nRead each section in order.\nRun each Python code block in your environment.\nKeep the generated week01_main.py, you can reuse functions and examples later.\n\n\n\n\nThis course pursues two complementary objectives because modern analytics and AI work demands both conceptual understanding and practical capability. On one hand, you need AI literacy, in this case what I mean by that is “a clear grasp of how data, models, and logic interact; how different AI paradigms operate; and how to interpret the behavior, limits, and risks of the systems you will use.” On the other hand, today’s employers expect job-ready skills: that is “the ability to run and troubleshoot basic Python code, understand and work with data pipelines, evaluate model outputs, write effective prompts, and understand when and how to apply different AI tools.” These two layers reinforce each other. The literacy perspective helps you reason about how AI systems work, and the applied skills prepare you to use those systems responsibly and effectively in real decision-making contexts. Together, they form the foundation for the rest of the course.\n\n\nBy the end of Week 1, you should be able to:\n\nDistinguish between analytics and artificial intelligence as conceptual frameworks for data-driven decision-making.\nExplain the foundational components shared by nearly all AI systems: data, models, and logic.\nDescribe the three major AI paradigms: symbolic, statistical, and neural—and understand how modern systems combine them.\nOutline the high-level flow of a data pipeline, from raw data ingestion to features, models, and business decisions.\nRecognize where Python fits into the broader ecosystem of analytics and AI tools.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of Week 1, you should be able to:\n\nNavigate the file system using a terminal (pwd, ls/dir, cd) and understand the difference between relative and absolute paths.\nOpen a project folder in VS Code, run a Python file, and interpret its output.\nWrite and execute simple Python statements—including basic arithmetic, variables, and print()—to test your environment.\nInstall required packages from a requirements.txt file and verify your setup by successfully importing key libraries.\nUnderstand, at a conceptual level, what a virtual environment is and why modern analytics/AI workflows rely on environment isolation."

No prior programming experience is required. The course is structured into two main sections. Students will first learn the basics of Python and how to write programs in Weeks 1-6. Weeks 6+ progress to using Python to solve real world analytical problems.\nWhy learn Python? Python is rapidly becoming the language of choice fordata scientists, data analysts, and those working on cutting edge business analytics. It is the tool of choice for this work at companies such as Google,Amazon, Facebook, IBM, NASA, Accenture, and Deloitte. It is also free to use, making it widely available to firms and users around the world. Beyond business analytics, Python is often used as a general programming language to automate tasks.\nWhy learn machine learning? Businesses today often use data to solve complex problems. A business that ignores the data it generates is at a significant disadvantage. The skills required to analyze and interpret that data are in short supply. A basic understanding of Artificial Intelligence and how it is used in business will be critical for tomorrows business leaders. Regardless of the domain a student decides to work in after graduation, it is likely that AI skills will make them more competitive in the job market."

    "section": "QUIZZES, SIMULATIONS AND EXAM DETAIL",
    "text": "QUIZZES, SIMULATIONS AND EXAM DETAIL\nNOTE: The number and weight of the assignments may be reduced during the semester at the discretion of the instructor. If a quiz or assignment is removed, the points for that assignment are also removed and are no longer considered when calculating the final grade. The final exam is harder than the midterm and the quizzes, so it is advisable to go into the final exam with a very good grade.\n\nSIMULATIONS\nThe simulation exercises test your understanding of the material to that date in the course. The first exercise has more coding, while the second exercise is almost exclusively related to testing your knowledge, understanding, and application of the analytics and AI approaches discussed in the lectures.\n\n\nWEEKLY QUIZ\nMost weeks of the course have a quiz. The quiz is open book, open notes, and untimed. Each quiz can be taken twice, and the highest score is retained. The due date for the quizzes (always the same each week) is posted on Canvas. I offer a 2-day automatic “grace” period for every quiz. This is intended to be used for emergencies only. The quiz is due on the due date. Without penalty and without approval, you can turn it in up to 2 days late. Keep in mind, of course, that were something to occur during the grace period, this would not be an adequate reason for an extension. You will need to show that you were not able to complete the quiz on time by the original due date, and that the 2-day grace period was inadequate to recover from that incident or problem and take the quiz. I believe these situations will be extremely rare.\nAt the end of the course, the 2 quizzes with the lowest grade will be dropped (not counted).\nThe quizzes in this course are designed to give you feedback on your current level of understanding. Many of the questions on the quiz have additional details and feedback available when the wrong/right answer is chosen. Be sure to read this after you have completed the quiz. This is important even if you scored very well; the additional details will help solidify your understanding of the material.\nA word about late or missing quizzes: I understand that sometimes life, minor illness, other classes, and just plain mistakes are made, and a quiz is missed or completed late. I don’t want to be the judge and jury of your misfortune. Sometimes bad things happen. The dropped quizzes and automatic grace period of 2 days per quiz allow you the privacy and flexibility to prioritize without worrying about my judgment or having one mistake result in a major grade impact. This grading does not remove an opportunity to make up a quiz due to an excused absence (see below), but given the generous “drop 2” policy and 2 days grace for grading, I would assume these are rare. The quizzes are open for 7 days; students who anticipate issues with conflicting activities should complete the quizzes earlier in the week. I believe, and hope you agree, this policy is clear, fair, and flexible. I ask in return that if you truly need an exception beyond this built-in flexibility, that you are clear and honest about that need.\nSome of the questions for the quizzes are from a question pool. You should not expect second attempts at a quiz to be identical. On a retake, the questions may change. The new questions from the pool may look very similar to the first quiz questions. It is critical if you want to improve your grade that you read and complete each question again carefully, and not just plug in your answers from your first quiz attempt.\n\n\nMIDTERM AND FINAL EXAM\nThe midterm exam will be drawn evenly from all lectures, worksheets, and readings that occurred up to that point in the course (Weeks 1-6). The final exam covers all the material after the midterm to the end of the course. It does not test material from prior to the midterm, but it is important to note that much of the code and analytics post-midterm is built on that earlier learning. You are responsible for all assigned material. Students should have a notebook up and running for the exam to assist with validating answers to code completion problems. The exams are proctored using Honorlock. Students are not permitted to use the internet or work with others during the exams.\nMIDTERM EXAM: The exam will be open and available to take anytime during the date range in Canvas. This may change slightly from this syllabus if we are behind or some event causes a delay.\nFINAL EXAM: The exam will be open and available to take anytime during the date range in Canvas. The dates in this syllabus are the current planned open and close dates for the exam, but Canvas should be your guide.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION\nWriting code and performing data analytics is often a collaborative exercise. You are free to discuss on Canvas or elsewhere any materials from the lectures or workbooks. Quizzes, simulations, and exams are individual efforts only. Please do not post answers or solutions from these in the forums or elsewhere online.\n\nUse of Generative AI tools or other AI tools\nThese may be used for any exercise or quiz, but not for the midterm or the final exam. You are free to use these tools, but keep in mind you are still responisble for learning the material."

The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor.\nA “class lecture” is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class session.\nPublication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To “publish” means to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.\nShould all or part of this class or open study sessions be offered via an online mechanism during this semester, our sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during these sessions, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the ”chat” feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live."

    "text": "Welcome to the course!\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the basics of data analytics and machine learning using the powerful programming language Python. No prior programming experience is required. The course is structured into two main sections. Students will first learn the basics of Python and how to write programs in Weeks 1-6. Weeks 6+ progress to using Python to solve real world analytical problems.\nWhy learn Python? Python is rapidly becoming the language of choice for data scientists, data analysts, and those working on cutting edge business analytics. It is the tool of choice for this work at companies such as Google,Amazon, Facebook, IBM, NASA, Accenture, and Deloitte. It is also free to use, making it widely available to firms and users around the world. Beyond business analytics, Python is often used as a general programming language to automate tasks.\nWhy learn machine learning? Businesses today often use data to solve complex problems. A business that ignores the data it generates is at a significant disadvantage. The skills required to analyze and interpret that data are in short supply. A basic understanding of Artificial Intelligence and how it is used in business will be critical for tomorrows business leaders. Regardless of the domain a student decides to work in after graduation, it is likely that AI skills will make them more competitive in the job market."

    "section": "QUIZZES, SIMULATIONS AND EXAM DETAIL",
    "text": "QUIZZES, SIMULATIONS AND EXAM DETAIL\nNOTE: The number and weight of the assignments may be reduced during the semester at the discretion of the instructor. If a quiz or assignment is removed, the points for that assignment are also removed and are no longer considered when calculating the final grade. The final exam is harder than the midterm and the quizzes, so it is advisable to go into the final exam with a very good grade. Make sure you prepare for the final exam!\n\nSIMULATIONS\nThe simulation exercises test your understanding of the material to that date in the course. The first exercise has more coding, while the second exercise is almost exclusively related to testing your knowledge, understanding, and application of the analytics and AI approaches discussed in the lectures.\nNote on Grading the Simulation Assignments: This simulation is intentionally challenging and designed to stretch your thinking. To ensure the grading reflects effort and relative mastery rather than absolute perfection, final scores will be curved based on the top 25% of performers. The average score of that top quartile will be mapped to full credit (40 points), and all other scores will be scaled proportionally. This approach ensures fairness while maintaining high standards. In practical terms this means when receiving your grade for this exercise, you should not panic. Once the exercise is complete, the curve will be calculated. The grades and the mapping used to generate them will be posted.\n\n\nWEEKLY QUIZ\nMost weeks of the course have a quiz. The quiz is open book, open notes, and untimed. Each quiz can be taken twice, and the highest score is retained. The due date for the quizzes (always the same each week) is posted on Canvas. I offer a 2-day automatic “grace” period for every quiz. This is intended to be used for emergencies only. The quiz is due on the due date. Without penalty and without approval, you can turn it in up to 2 days late. Keep in mind, of course, that were something to occur during the grace period, this would not be an adequate reason for an extension. You will need to show that you were not able to complete the quiz on time by the original due date, and that the 2-day grace period was inadequate to recover from that incident or problem and take the quiz. I believe these situations will be extremely rare.\nAt the end of the course, the 2 quizzes with the lowest grade will be dropped (not counted).\nThe quizzes in this course are designed to give you feedback on your current level of understanding. Many of the questions on the quiz have additional details and feedback available when the wrong/right answer is chosen. Be sure to read this after you have completed the quiz. This is important even if you scored very well; the additional details will help solidify your understanding of the material.\nA word about late or missing quizzes: I understand that sometimes life, minor illness, other classes, and just plain mistakes are made, and a quiz is missed or completed late. I don’t want to be the judge and jury of your misfortune. Sometimes bad things happen. The dropped quizzes and automatic grace period of 2 days per quiz allow you the privacy and flexibility to prioritize without worrying about my judgment or having one mistake result in a major grade impact. This grading does not remove an opportunity to make up a quiz due to an excused absence (see below), but given the generous “drop 2” policy and 2 days grace for grading, I would assume these are rare. The quizzes are open for 7 days; students who anticipate issues with conflicting activities should complete the quizzes earlier in the week. I believe, and hope you agree, this policy is clear, fair, and flexible. I ask in return that if you truly need an exception beyond this built-in flexibility, that you are clear and honest about that need.\nSome of the questions for the quizzes are from a question pool. You should not expect second attempts at a quiz to be identical. On a retake, the questions may change. The new questions from the pool may look very similar to the first quiz questions. It is critical if you want to improve your grade that you read and complete each question again carefully, and not just plug in your answers from your first quiz attempt.\nThroughout the course, you’ll encounter occasional graded survey-style questions. These questions are worth just a few points, and are graded for completion (completing the survey is full points). They are an easy way to add some cushion to your grade. Their purpose is to give you a chance to reflect on your learning and to help me (your instructor) gauge how the class is progressing. Your responses help identify what concepts are clear, what might need more explanation, and how I can improve the course in real time. Your honest input is greatly appreciated and contributes to making this a more responsive and effective learning experience for everyone.\n\n\nMIDTERM AND FINAL EXAM\nThe midterm exam will be drawn evenly from all lectures, worksheets, and readings that occurred up to that point in the course (Weeks 1-6). The final exam covers all the material after the midterm to the end of the course. It does not test material from prior to the midterm, but it is important to note that much of the code and analytics post-midterm is built on that earlier learning. You are responsible for all assigned material. Students should have a notebook up and running for the exam to assist with validating answers to code completion problems. The exams are proctored using Honorlock. Students are not permitted to use the internet or work with others during the exams.\nMIDTERM EXAM: The exam will be open and available to take anytime during the date range in Canvas. This may change slightly from this syllabus if we are behind or some event causes a delay.\nFINAL EXAM: The exam will be open and available to take anytime during the date range in Canvas. The dates in this syllabus are the current planned open and close dates for the exam, but Canvas should be your guide.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION\nWriting code and performing data analytics is often a collaborative exercise. You are free to discuss on Canvas or elsewhere any materials from the lectures or workbooks. Quizzes, simulations, and exams are individual efforts only. Please do not post answers or solutions from these in the forums or elsewhere online.\n\nUse of Generative AI tools or other AI tools\nYou are permitted to use generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or similar technologies) for most course activities, including the graded quizzes, exercises, and assignments. However, AI tools may not be used during the midterm or final exam, which are intended to assess your individual understanding."

The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor.\nA “class lecture” is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class session.\nPublication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To “publish” means to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.\nShould all or part of this class or open study sessions be offered via an online mechanism during this semester, our sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during these sessions, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the ”chat” feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live."
