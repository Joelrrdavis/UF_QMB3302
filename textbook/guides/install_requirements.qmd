title: "Installing the Course Requirements and Checking Your Environment"
---

# Overview

This guide will walk you through:

- Downloading the course **requirements file**  
- Using the **terminal / command line** to navigate to your course folder  
- Installing the required Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- Running a small Python script to confirm that everything is set up correctly  

By the end of this guide, your Python environment should be ready for the rest of the semester.

# Before You Start

You should already have:

- **Python 3** installed  
- **VS Code** installed (or another editor, but VS Code is recommended)  
- A main course folder on your computer, for example:

```text
AI_Course/
  week01/
  week02/
  ...
```

If you do **not** have this yet, complete the Python setup instructions first.

# Step 1 — Download the Environment Files

Your instructor will provide two files (for example in Canvas) for Week 1:

1. `requirements.txt`  
2. `check_environment.py`  

## 1.1 — Download the files

1. Go to the location where your instructor has shared the files.  
2. Download `requirements.txt`.  
3. Download `check_environment.py`.

## 1.2 — Save them to your Week 1 folder

Save both files in:

```text
AI_Course/week01/
```

So your folder structure looks like:

```text
AI_Course/
  week01/
    requirements.txt
    check_environment.py
  week02/
  ...
```

---

# Step 2 — Open a Terminal / Command Line

## Windows (VS Code recommended)

1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Click **File → Open Folder…** → select `AI_Course/week01/`.  
3. Go to **View → Terminal**.

## macOS / Linux

1. Open **Terminal**.  
2. Use `cd` to navigate to your Week 1 folder (see next step).

---

# Step 3 — Change Directory to Week 1

### Windows

```bash
cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\AI_Course\week01
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
cd ~/AI_Course/week01
```

Check your location:

```bash
pwd
```

You should see a path ending with:

```
.../AI_Course/week01
```

---

# Step 4 — Install Required Packages

### Windows

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternate:

```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Step 5 — Run the Environment Check

### Windows

```bash
py check_environment.py
```

or:

```bash
python check_environment.py
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 check_environment.py
```

Expected output:

```
All core packages imported successfully!
Environment check passed.
```

---

# Troubleshooting

### `'pip' is not recognized`
Python may not be on your PATH. Restart terminal or reinstall with PATH enabled.

### `ModuleNotFoundError`
You may not be in the same environment where you installed packages.

### File not found
Ensure you are in the `week01` directory before running commands.

# Appendix — Example Files

### Example `requirements.txt`
```
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
requests
seaborn
```

### Example `check_environment.py`
```python
import sys

def main():
    print("Running environment check...\n")
    try:
        import pandas as pd
        import matplotlib
        import sklearn
        import requests
    except ImportError as e:
        print("Environment check FAILED.")
        print("Missing package:", e)
        sys.exit(1)
    print("All core packages imported successfully!")
    print("Environment check passed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
