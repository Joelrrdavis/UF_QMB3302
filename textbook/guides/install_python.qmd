title: "Setting Up Python"
---

# Overview

This document will walk you through the steps to:

- Install **Python 3**  
- Install **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
- Configure VS Code to run `.py` files  
- Verify that everything is working correctly  

You only need to complete this setup **once** on your computer.  
After that, you will be able to run all course examples and labs.

**If you get stuck at any point:**  
Installing this should be straightforward. LLMs can be a great way to problem solve an install. Use UFs Navigator Chat to help you. There is an optional video on this in the course files. Still stuck? Reach out to a TA and let them help you out. Use the course guidelines for *how to ask good questions* to request help.

# Step 1 — Check if Python Is Already Installed

Before installing anything, let’s see whether Python is already on your system.

## On Windows?

1. Open the **Start Menu**.  
2. Type `cmd` and press **Enter** to open the Command Prompt.  
3. In the black window, type:

```bash
py --version
```

or

```bash
python --version
```

4. Press **Enter**.

- If you see something like `Python 3.10.11`, Python 3 is already installed.  
- If you see an error or a much older version (like `Python 2.x`), you should install a current version.
- Most MAC's will have Python installed, but this is for your system, you want to install it again. We don't want to be making changes to the factory installed Python. 

## on macOS?

1. Open **Terminal** (Spotlight → type `Terminal`).  
2. Type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

3. Press **Enter**.

- If you see `Python 3.x.x`, you have Python 3.  
- For the most part, you should install a new version, even if you see this.

## on Linux?

1. Open a terminal.  
2. Type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

3. Press **Enter**.

If Python 3 is **not** installed, follow the installation steps below.

# Step 2 — Install Python 3

Go to the official Python website in your browser:

<https://www.python.org/downloads/>

Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system.

## Windows Installation

1. Click **Download Python 3.x.x** for Windows.  
2. Run the installer (`python-3.x.x.exe`) after it downloads.  
3. On the first screen:

   - **Check the box** that says:  
     **"Add Python 3.x to PATH"**  
   - Then click **"Install Now"**.

4. Wait for the installation to finish.  
5. Click **"Close"** when done.

### Verify Python on Windows

Open **Command Prompt** again and type:

```bash
py --version
```

or

```bash
python --version
```

You should now see `Python 3.x.x`.

If you don’t, restart your computer and try again.

## macOS Installation

1. On <https://www.python.org/downloads/>, choose **"Download Python 3.x.x for macOS"**.  
2. Open the downloaded `.pkg` file.  
3. Follow the installer prompts and accept the defaults.  

### Verify Python on macOS

Open **Terminal** and type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see `Python 3.x.x`.

If you don’t, log out and back in, or restart your machine.

## Linux Installation (brief)

On many Linux distributions, Python 3 is already installed.  
If not, you can install it with your package manager. For example:

- **Ubuntu / Debian:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
  ```

- **Fedora:**

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
  ```

After installation, check:

```bash
python3 --version
```

# Step 3 — Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

We will use **Visual Studio Code** as the main editor for this course.

## Download and Install VS Code

1. Go to: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>  
2. Click **Download** for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).  
3. Run the installer and accept the defaults.

## Install the Python Extension in VS Code

1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. On the left sidebar, click the **Extensions** icon (four squares).  
3. In the search bar, type: `Python`.  
4. Find the extension published by **Microsoft** (it should be at the top).  
5. Click **Install**.

VS Code will now understand and support Python files.

# Step 4 — Create a Course Folder

To stay organized, create a main folder for this course.

For example:

- On Windows: `Documents\AI_Course`  
- On macOS/Linux: `~/AI_Course`

Inside that folder, create subfolders for each week. For example:

```text
AI_Course/
  week01/
  week02/
  week03/
  ...
```

Each week’s HTML, `.py`, and data files will live inside the corresponding `weekXX` folder.

This matches how we structure materials in Canvas.

# Step 5 — Open a Week Folder in VS Code

1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Click **File → Open Folder…**.  
3. Choose the folder for the current week, for example: `week01`.  
4. Click **Open**.

You should now see the folder in the VS Code **Explorer** panel on the left.

When you download `.py` files from Canvas, save them inside this week’s folder.

# Step 6 — Run Your First Python Script

Let’s confirm everything is working.

1. Inside your `week01` folder (so make sure you have followed Step 5 above), create a file called `test_setup.py`.  
2. Open `test_setup.py` in VS Code and type:

```python
print("Python is working, awesome!")
```
(you can type whatever you want, but if you got it working, I think that's awesome)

3. Save the file.

## Running the Script (VS Code Integrated Terminal)

1. In VS Code, open the **Terminal**:

   - **View → Terminal**, or  
   - Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> (Windows/Linux)  
   - Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> (macOS, depending on keybindings)

2. Make sure the terminal is using the correct folder. You should see a path that ends with `week01`.

3. Type **one** of the following commands and press Enter:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     py test_setup.py
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     python test_setup.py
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     python3 test_setup.py
     ```

4. You should see:

```text
Python is working, awesome!
```

If you see that message, your environment is ready.

# Step 7 — Installing Required Packages (Later in the Course)

Some weeks will require additional Python packages (for example, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, or `matplotlib`).

We will clearly list any required packages in the weekly instructions.

In general, you will install a package using:

```bash
pip install package-name
```

Examples:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
```

On some systems, you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install pandas
```

If you get a “permission denied” error, try:

```bash
pip install --user pandas
```

We will provide package lists when needed; you do **not** need to guess on your own.

# Step 8 — Common Issues and Tips

## “Python is not recognized” on Windows

If you see:

```text
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

or

```text
'py' is not recognized...
```

Try:

1. Restarting your computer.  
2. Running the installer again and making sure **“Add Python to PATH”** is checked.  



## Scripts not finding data files

Make sure:

- Your `.py` script and your data files are in the **same folder**, or  
- Your script uses the correct relative path, like:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/housing_prices.csv")
```

If you move files around, update the paths accordingly.

# Summary

By the end of this setup, you should have:

- Python 3 installed and working  
- Visual Studio Code installed with the Python extension  
- A clean folder structure for this course  
- The ability to run a `.py` script from within VS Code  

You only need to complete this setup once.  

Once this is working, you are ready to start Week 1.
